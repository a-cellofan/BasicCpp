# Part III: Tokens on C++

## Tokens

![**Scheme 2**: Basic Syntax in C/C++](fig/basic_syntax.png)

## Identifiers

Any name element is an identifier. They are basically names given
by the programmer. It is any variable, function, data definition, etc.

### Rules:

1. Alphabet, digits and underscore are allowed.
2. They can not start with a digit.
3. keywords can be used as identifiers.
4. It is case-sensitive.
5. Special characters are not permitted.

### Practice:

**EXERCISE 6**: Please, create a new project (p5?) in the workspace and copy the source code of 
[identifiers.cpp file](src/identifiers.cpp) on to the new main.cpp file. You should have something
like this:

![](fig/01_identifiers.png)

Please, read carefully the program statements and the comments above them.
There are several mistakes that should be related with the rules above mentioned.
Correct them and compile/run the program. Try to answer next questions:

- Is it working? 
- Why not? 
- What do the compiler say about them? 

## Keywords and special characters

Here there is the list of keywords:

![](fig/01_keywords.png)

Here is the list of special characters:

![](fig/01_specialchar.png)

They can not be used as identifiers (named variables, functions, etc. )

### Practice:

**EXERCISE 7**: Please, identify the keywords and special characters, using the lists above, in [identifiers.cpp program](src/identifiers.cpp)

## Constants and Types

### Constants

- They are any integer number or float point, such as *8* or *19.27*.
- They are any single letter between single quotation marks, such as *'\\n'* or *'a'*.
- They are strings between double quotation marks, such as *"Hello world\n"*.

### Fundamental types

You use them to *define variables* of **type**:

* **void** (empty type): represent nothing(?).
* **bool** : only can be **true** or **false**;
* **char** : variable can store characters such as *'a'*, *'b'*, *'\n'*, *'\t'*,etc.
* **int**  : you can represent integer numbers.
	- *Modifiers* (Signedness): **signed/unsigned**
	- *Size*: **sort/long/long long**

![**table 1: Integer properties**](fig/01_integerprop.png)

* Floating point: you can represent real numbers. 
	- 	**float**: 16 bits real numbers.
	- 	**double**: 32 bits real numbers.
	- 	**long double**: 64 bits real numbers.

![**table 2:Range of validity of each type**](fig/02_range.png)

### Transformation between types (casting)

You can transform variables of **certain** types in other variables 
with different types. The process is as follows:

**int intvar = (int) floatvar** 
where floatvar is a "**float**" type.

### Practice:

**EXERCISE 8**:Please, create a new project (p6?) in the workspace and copy the source code of 
[ctetypes.cpp file](src/ctetypes.cpp) on to the new main.cpp file. You should have something
like this:

![](fig/01_typescast.png)

Please, read carefully the program statements and the comments above them.
Compile/run the code:

-  Is there any mistake? where? What does the compiler say? 
-  Change the variable s\_string by i\_number, Compile and run....

## C++ Operators

Let's consider that A = 4 and B = 2:

### Arithmetic Operators:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    Description 								   Example 
---------- --------------------------------------------- ----------
\+		     Adds two operands or variables           	  A + B = 6
 
\-   	     Subtracts second operand from the first 	  A - B = 2
 
\*		     Multiplies both operands                 	  A * B = 8
 
\/   	     Divides numerator by denominator       	  A / B = 2
 
\%  	     After dividing the numerator by denominator  
		     remainder will be returned after division    A \% B= 0
 
\+\+  	     Increment operator will increase integer    
		     value by one                                 A++ = 5  
 
\-\-  	     Increment operator will decrease integer             
		     value by one                                 A-- = 3  
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Relational Operators:


---------------------------------------------------------
Symbol 		Meaning					Example
-------- ------------------------ -----------------------
\>			Greater than			A > B returns true

\<			Less than				A < B returns false

\>\=		Greater than equal to	A >= B returns false

\<\=		Less than equal to      A <= B returns false

\=\=    	Equal to 				A == B returns false

\!\=		Not equal to 			A != B returns true

---------------------------------------------------------

### Logical Operators:


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator 		Description								 Example
------------ ------------------------------------------  -------------
Logical AND		If both operands are non-zero then		 (A && B) is  
(&&)			only condition becomes true				 false
Logical OR		If both operands are zero then only		 ( A || B) is
(\|\|)			condition becomes false					 true

Logical Not     It will reverses the sate of its operand !(A) is true
(\!)            i.e. true will become false

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment Operators

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator		Description							Example
--------------- ----------------------------------- ---------------
\=				assignment operator 				A = 10

+=				Increase a certain number           A += 2 (A = 6)

-=				Decrease a certain number 			A -= 3 (A = 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bitwise Operators.

(out of the scope of this course )


### Practice:

**EXERCISE 9**:Please, create a new project (p7?) in the workspace and copy the source code of 
[operators.cpp file](src/operators.cpp) on to the new main.cpp file. You should have something
like this:

![](fig/01_operators.png)

Please, read carefully the program statements and the comments above them.
Compile/run the code.
