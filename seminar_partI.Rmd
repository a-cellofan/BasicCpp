# Part I: Motivation & introduction to C/C++

## What is C/C++?

-   C was created in 1973 by the father of C programming Language and creator of UNIX: 

![**Figure 1**: Dennis Ritche](fig/Dennis.png)

- 	C is a structured language: based in structures, blocks & subroutines: 
    like for-loops, while, etc.
- 	C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming l	 language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.
- 	C++ development started in 1979 by

- 	C++ allows an object orientated style programming of C (OOP):
	Any compiler of C++ is able to compile C (not viceversa ).
- 	C produces the fastest code of any structured language: C++ is slightly slower than C.
-   C/C++ is multi-platform.
-   C is today the most popular system programming language.
-   Many important programs are created using C: MySQL, many Linux distributions. 
-   Several versions: Visual C++, Borland C++, Turbo C++, Standardize C++ (ANSI C++).

## Why to use C/C++?

-   C is **fast**: as fast as code written in assembly language.
-   C/C++ is **THE system programming language**:
	+   OS (first versions of Windows and Macintosh, for example)
	+   Assemblers.
	+   Print Spoolers (they are programs that performs the printing work).
	+   Network Drivers (Programs that work with the network hardware ).
	+   Databases (They have you in Google DBS , Bank DBS, etc.).
	+   Language interpreters (Matlab, Mathematica, Perl, Python, etc. ).
	+   Text editors (MS office).

-   C/C++ is used for the most of the programmers in **many areas**:
-   C++ offers the possibility of **programming with different styles**: C, Fortran,
	meta-programming, etc. 
-   C++ has the Standard-Template-Library (STL): It is a group of algorithms programmed 
    in a very efficient and general style.
-   C/C++ is used in **research and teaching**: it is clean and easy to explain easy concepts.
-   C/C++ is **portable**, only need a compiler (installed in most of computers).
-   OOP allows: 
	* Facilitate the creation of large projects.
	* Define abstract data types.
	* Implementation details are hidden from other modules(interface).
	* It is easy to maintain and modify existing code.
	* etc. 

## The compiler

## C/C++ portability

- Portability of any language depends on the object code created by the compiler.
- C/C++ compiler produce machine code which is directly executed by the CPU.
- C/C++ code is therefore machine dependent and tied to a particular Operative System (OS).
- We must try to recompile the program before executing program if we change OS.
- Java and C# are portables since their compiler only generate intermediate code that is 
  interpreted by the corresponding **Interpreter**. 
- Matlab, Mathematica, perl, bash... are script languages,
  where a program (**Interpreter**) is compiled every time that is executed.
